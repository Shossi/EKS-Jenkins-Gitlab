# Jenkins-GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Project

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.jpeg)

## Overview

This project automates the deployment of a cloud infrastructure using Terraform, with continuous integration and deployment pipelines managed by Jenkins and GitLab. The main components include:

- Jenkins (Server-Agent)
- GitLab Server
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- Terraform
- Slack for notifications

For detailed information about the infrastructure setup and Terraform modules, please refer to the [Terraform Documentation](./devops/terraform/README.md).

## Infrastructure Overview

The infrastructure is entirely managed by Terraform and includes two VPCsâ€”one for Jenkins, GitLab, and the bastion host, and the other for the EKS cluster and its associated components. For more details, please see the [Terraform Documentation](./devops/terraform/README.md).

## Terraform Components

### VPCs and Subnets

- **VPC 1**: Dedicated for Jenkins, GitLab, and the bastion host with **1 private subnet and 1 public subnet**.
- **VPC 2**: Dedicated for the EKS cluster with **2 private subnets and 2 public subnets** for secure networking.

### Security Groups

- **VPC 1**: Security Groups for Jenkins, GitLab, and the bastion host.
- **VPC 2**: Security Groups for the EKS cluster and its associated components.

### Instances (VPC 1)

- `Jenkins Agent`: Deployed in the private subnet.
- `Jenkins Controller`: Deployed in the private subnet.
- `GitLab`: Deployed in the private subnet.
- `Bastion Host`: Deployed in the public subnet for secure SSH access.

### Load Balancer (VPC 1)

- Application Load Balancer with listeners for Jenkins and GitLab.
  - `Jenkins`: port 8080
  - `GitLab`: port 80

### EKS Cluster (VPC 2)

- The EKS cluster is deployed in VPC 2 with nodes in private subnets and necessary IAM roles provisioned through Terraform.
- The cluster is configured with the following key add-ons and Helm charts:

#### Add-ons Deployed via Terraform:
- **CoreDNS**: Enables service discovery within the cluster.
- **VPC CNI**: Integrates Kubernetes networking with AWS VPC for efficient pod networking.
- **Kube-Proxy**: Manages networking rules and service communication across nodes.
- **CloudWatch Agent**: Collects and pushes logs and metrics from the cluster to AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.

#### Helm Charts Deployed:
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on CPU and memory usage.
- **AWS Load Balancer Controller**: Manages AWS Application Load Balancers for services exposed via Kubernetes.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment tool that automatically deploys application updates when changes are made to the GitHub repository.

## Pipelines

![Pipeline Diagram](./pipeline.jpeg)

### Branches Pipeline

- Stages:
    - Build Docker Image
    - Test Docker Image

- `Trigger`: Merge Request to Master branch.

### Master Pipeline

- Stages:
    - Determines the source branch of the merge request.
    - Updates the version depending on the source branch (Major for `release/*`, Minor for `feature/*`, Patch for `hotfix/*`).
    - Builds the artifact (Docker image).
    - Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub ([yossizxc/weather](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yossizxc/weather/general)).
    - Updates the values.yaml file in the GitHub repository with the new image tag.
    - ArgoCD detects the change in the GitHub repository and automatically redeploys the updated application on the Kubernetes cluster.

- `Trigger`: Accepted Merge Request to Master Branch.

---

## Application

- **Weather API:**
    - A Flask application using Gunicorn as a WSGI server.

---

## Tests

- **Connectivity Test:**
    - Checks if the server is running properly by sending a request to the localhost on the specified port.

- **Code Linting:**
    - A pre-push Git hook runs pylint to ensure code quality before code is pushed to the repository.

---

## AWS CloudWatch Monitoring

This project uses AWS CloudWatch to monitor the infrastructure:

- **EC2 Instance Monitoring:**
    - Collects metrics such as CPU utilization, disk usage, and memory usage.
    - Configured using the AWS CloudWatch Agent.

- **EKS Monitoring:**
    - The **Cloud Observability Agent** is deployed to collect and send logs and metrics from the EKS cluster to CloudWatch.
  
- **CloudWatch Alarms:**
    - Alarms set up to notify when thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage) are breached.
    - Notifications sent via SNS to your email.

---

## Configurations

### Jenkins

- **Credentials:**
    - GitLab account for SCM connection.
    - AWS Credentials.
    - DockerHub Credentials.
    - SSH key or other configurations for agent-controller connection.
    - Slack Credentials.

- **Pipelines:**
    - Create two pipelines with the relevant configurations:
        - One for created and updated merge requests.
        - One for accepted merge requests (includes additional parameters).

- **Shared Groovy Library:**
    - Used to implement and maintain the versioning scheme and configuration.

### GitLab

- **Webhooks:**
    - One webhook for the branch pipeline (builds and tests).
    - Another webhook for the deployment pipeline (triggered upon merge request acceptance).
